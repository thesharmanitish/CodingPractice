 * https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-select-buildings/submissions/
 * 
 * You are given a 0-indexed binary string s which represents the types of
 * buildings along a street where:
 * 
 * s[i] = '0' denotes that the ith building is an office and s[i] = '1' denotes
 * that the ith building is a restaurant. As a city official, you would like to
 * select 3 buildings for random inspection. However, to ensure variety, no two
 * consecutive buildings out of the selected buildings can be of the same type.
 * 
 * For example, given s = "001101", we cannot select the 1st, 3rd, and 5th
 * buildings as that would form "011" which is not allowed due to having two
 * consecutive buildings of the same type. Return the number of valid ways to
 * select 3 buildings.
