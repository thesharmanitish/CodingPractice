 * 
 * (a - b >= 0) The entire game is based on understanding the Circle for example
 * : -2147483648 cannot become positive by Maths.abs() but ..........+2147483648
 * -1=+2147483647 which is exactly wats happening when we're doing
 * -2147483648-1=+2147483647.
 * 
 * Math.abs(Integer.MIN_VALUE) would cause an overflow and would cause an issue.
 * Yes, you are right about the first part. It indeed causes an overflow, but
 * this overflow is quickly countered by the underflow.
 * 
 * Math.abs(Integer.MIN_VALUE) is still Integer.MIN_VALUE. Give this a thought.
 * When you covert it to positive value, it would overflow by one. Adding one to
 * Integer.MAX_VALUE would lead to Integer.MIN_VALUE;
 * 
 * And the critical trick here is you need to use a - b >= 0 as the condition. a
 * right now is still Integer.MIN_VALUE, b is a positive number larger than 1
 * (since we handled the case where b is 1 explicitly). Now Integer.MIN_VALUE
 * minus a positive value would cause underflow, which wraps back to the
 * Integer.MAX_VALUE.
 * 
 * In summary, when dividend is Integer.MIN_VALUE, a is the overflow outcome.
 * However, it is not a problem, since a-b underflows. The final result a-b is
 * just the expected result, despite we just had one overflow and underflow.
 * This a-b >= 0 trick is important. If you change the condition to a >= b,
 * which is logically equivalent, you will get the wrong output.
 * 
 * It's not a bug, it's a feature. :)
 * 
 * Calculate complexity for below solution A doubly nested for loop that looks
 * like the following would have a time complexity of O(n^2):
 * 
 * for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){ for(int j = 0; j < i; j++){ //... }
 * 
 * }
 * 
 * Similarly, the code I'm running is doing the following: Let's say a is 100, b
 * is 2,4,8,16,32,64, stopping before 100. while( a - (b << 1 << x) >= 0){ x++;
 * } In our code, b is like the j pointer, a is like the i pointer. Then a is
 * decremented because of this line a -= b << x; so a would be readjusted to 36
 * ( 100 - 64 ). b starts again from 2. So b loops from 2,4,8,16,32, stopping
 * before 36.
 * 
 * So you can deduce by analogy the n^2 where n would be dividend. The reason
 * log comes into this is because we are squaring b at each step. The log is a
 * logarithm of base 2.
